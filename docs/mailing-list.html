<h3>Joining Data-PASS JEDI</h3>
				<p>Only members may post to the Data-PASS JEDI mailing list and read its archives. We welcome membership by:</p>
<ul class="simpleList">
<li>current and former journal editors (including managing and associate editors) and other editorial staff;</li>
<li>representatives and staff from Data-PASS domain repositories; and </li>
<li>representatives from data management entities that the JEDI steering committee believes have experience and expertise that will be helpful in answering questions and addressing issues raised on the mailing list</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data-PASS JEDI mailing list guidelines</h3>

<p>The goal of the Data-PASS JEDI mailing list is to allow participants to solicit the advice of their peers, benefit from their experience, and participate in an ongoing conversation. To help provide the best possible experience for all mailing list members, we request that everyone be aware of, and follow, some guidelines and rules for participation, and some rules of etiquette.</p>
<ul class="simpleList">
<li>A moderator screens all messages sent to the mailing list.</li>
<li>JEDI runs on Google groups.</li>
<li>By using Data-PASS JEDI you agree that you have read and will follow the guidelines set for this peer discussion forum. You also agree to reserve list discussions for topics best suited to the medium.</li>
<li>Please take a moment to acquaint yourself with these important guidelines. If you have questions, please contact <a href="mailto:datapassjedi@gmail.com">datapassjedi@gmail.com</a>.</li>
<li>Please note that in order to encourage fruitful dialogue, Data-PASS reserves the right to suspend or terminate membership of individuals who violate these terms. If you do not accept these guidelines, please unsubscribe from the list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data-PASS JEDI mailing list rules</h3>

<ul class="simpleList">
<li>Please be civil, seeking to express any disagreements you may have without flaming, demeaning, or insulting others.</li>
<li>In all discussion, please avoid identifying particular authors or manuscripts. For example, because of the nature of the subject matter, questions raised on the list may have been sparked by a particular submission. Please only include the information that is needed to ask your question clearly. Similarly, in answering questions editors may want to reference their experience with a previous submission. Again, please only include the information that is needed to allow you to make your point.</li>
<li>Do not post unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or hateful content; sexually explicit images; or content that is racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable, or which infringes on the rights of any third party</li>
<li>Advertising or commercial solicitation is not permitted. In response to particular questions, members may recommend relevant commercially available products, but must note if they have a financial or other interest in the product they are recommending.</li>
<li>Do not distribute any SPAM, solicitation, jokes, chain letters, petitions for signatures or letters relating to pyramid schemes, missing persons or once-in-a-lifetime deals.</li>
<li>The lingua franca of Data-PASS JEDI is English.  Posting in other languages is very welcome, but questions posed or issues raised in English are more likely to elicit responses.</li>
<li>Items posted are permanently archived, can be searched by mailing list members, and might be shared and republished.  They are not deleted, they do not sunset and go offline at any particular time, and they cannot be edited again after publication.  Submit items in the expectation that they will never be removed and do not include contact or other details that you regard as personal and private.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data-PASS JEDI mailing list Etiquette</h3>
<ul class="simpleList">
<li>Include a signature tag on all messages with your name, affiliation, location, and e-mail address.</li>

<li>State concisely and clearly the topic of your comments in the subject line. This allows members to respond more appropriately to your posting and makes it easier for members to search the archives by subject.</li>

<li>Include only the relevant portions of the original message in your reply. Delete any header information, and put your response before the original posting.</li>

<li>Only send a message to the entire list when it contains information that benefits everyone.</li>

<li>Send messages such as "thanks for the information" or "me, too" to individuals--not to the entire list. Do this by using your e-mail application's forwarding option and typing in or cutting and pasting in the e-mail address of the individual to whom you want to respond.</li>

<li>Do not send administrative messages, such as "remove me from the list", through the mailing list. To unsubscribe from the list, follow the directions at the bottom of the mailing list email message.</li>

<li>Warn other list subscribers of lengthy messages either in the subject line or at the beginning of the message body with a line that says "Long Message."</li>
</ul>
