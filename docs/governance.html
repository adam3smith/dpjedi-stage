				<h3>Sponsors</h3>

<p>The Data-PASS JEDI listserv is sponsored by several members of the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (Data‐PASS).  Data-PASS is a voluntary partnership of organizations created to archive, catalog, and preserve data used for social science research.

<p>Members of Data-PASS include:</p>

<h3>Steering Committee</h3>

Data-PASS JEDI policies are decided by a steering committee, consisting of representatives from each of the Data-PASS repositories, and the editors of five social science journals. Each representative serves a two-year term. The first five editors were invited to participate by the Data-PASS representatives; thereafter they will be elected by listserv members.</p>
